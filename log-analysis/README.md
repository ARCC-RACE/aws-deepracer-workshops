## Running the notebooks

I recommend setting up a venv for this:
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
(I recommend folder venv as I have already added it to .gitignore)
Then activate:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
Then install dependencies:
```
pip install shapely matplotlib pandas sklearn boto3 awscli jupyter
```
Then run
```
jupyter notebook
```
From the opened page you can select a notebook to work with.
